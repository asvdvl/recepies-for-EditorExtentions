[mod-setting-description]
rfEE_allow_all_items=Basically only recipes are presented for which I can find a legal craft, this setting includes other items, but without ingredients (i.e. free) (because the only thing I can think of is a partial hardcode)
rfEE_type_of_compensation_category=Each "functional" item has a category in data.raw, that's what I need here, also the criteria for evaluating the item should be written in defines.lua of my mod
rfEE_divider_time_to_craft_overpower_items=basically, I needed to somehow compensate for the fact that the amount of input does not correspond to the output, so I decided to increase the crafting time, but if this does not suit you, you can specify a divisor here to reduce this time
rfEE_debug=spams a bunch of logs
rfEE_always_overwrite_from_balancing=essentially forces items in recipes from user settings (below)
